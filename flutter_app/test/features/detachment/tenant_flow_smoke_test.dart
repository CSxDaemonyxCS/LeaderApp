/// proves that every screen on the main path builds without throwing, which
/// is the failure this feature could plausibly introduce and the one that is
/// invisible until someone opens the app.
///
/// **Known pre-existing failure this test tolerates.** `GlassBottomNav` caps
/// its pill at 380px and divides it between four tabs, which leaves the
/// selected tab about 50px short of its icon-plus-label — so the nav reports
/// a horizontal overflow at every window size, on `main` as much as here.
/// It is filtered rather than fixed because it predates this work and fixing
/// it was not asked for; see the note in the session handoff.
/// Swallows the known bottom-nav overflow described above and nothing else.
///
/// Installed inside the test body rather than in `setUp`, because the test
/// binding installs its own handler when the body starts and would otherwise
