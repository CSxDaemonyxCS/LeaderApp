/// The app's single startup / session decision.
///
/// **Why this file exists.** Before it, "where does this launch belong" was
/// spread across `appRouterProvider`'s `redirect` as a chain of `if`s that
/// each knew one fact — the upgrade gate, then a three-arm switch on
/// `AuthGate`, then two lines about `super_admin`. Every new session state
/// (a suspended account, a deleted customer, a demo workspace, an account with
/// no assigned access) would have added another `if` to that chain, in an
/// order nobody had written down, inside a closure no test could call
/// directly. So the decision moved here: **one enum, one pure function, one
/// documented priority.** The router consumes the answer; it does not compute
/// one.
///
/// **It is pure.** [resolveStartup] takes a record and returns a value — no
/// `Ref`, no `BuildContext`, no provider read, no import of a screen. That is
/// what makes the whole state table testable without pumping a widget, and it
/// is why the canonical route strings live on [StartupDestination] rather than
/// on the pages: a decision layer that imported presentation could not stay
/// pure, and two spellings of `/platform` is how a redirect loop ships.
///
/// **It is a UX gate, like every access decision in this client.** It keeps a
/// session off a surface that would fail or mislead. The backend refuses the
/// request regardless — see the contract at the top of
/// `core/access/capability.dart`.

///     is the documented deviation from "boot first": the existing gate
///     (`AppVersionController`) only ever *blocks when it has found a reason*,
///     so a launch that has not answered yet is not blocked and falls through
///     to (2) exactly as if this step were second.
///  2. **Restoring.** Until the session read lands nothing else is known, and
///     guessing here is what produces a flash of the wrong surface.
///  3. **Expired**, then (4) **invalid**, then (5) **signed out** — the three
///     authentication answers, ordered most-specific first. Expired and
///     invalid each say something a login form cannot.
///     **Point 17A:** "signed out" (and "unknown, no cached account") now
///     first asks the pre-session journey, in this order — see
///     [_entryDestination]:
///       a. stored journey not read yet → restoring;
///       b. refused onboarding payload → invalid;
///       c. verification pending → email verification;
///       d. onboarding session → unsupported value; account revoked,
///          suspended; not linked → Team Code; linked tenant deleted,
///          deletion pending, suspended; setup (incomplete *or* complete and
///          awaiting its full session) → account setup;
///       e. nothing → the ordinary answer (sign-in form, or unresolved).
///     Account lifecycle outranks the link, and tenant lifecycle outranks
///     setup — the same reasons as (7)–(12) below: a withdrawn account is
///     told that, and a blocked tenant does not invite anyone to finish.
///     Verification needs no rank of its own among them: a challenge exists
///     only *before* any session, so it can never coincide with (d).
/// 5a. **Server-issued session timestamp already elapsed.** The same expired
///     outcome as the repository's `authentication_expired`; checked locally
///     only when the optional envelope field is present.
/// 5b. **Unsupported access state.** Directly below the authentication
///     answers and above every authorization question, because it is the
///     statement *this build cannot evaluate the rest of this table*. Lower
///     would mean deciding MFA, a suspension or a surface out of an envelope
///     already known to be unreadable; higher would tell someone whose session
///     merely expired that their app is out of date.
///  6. **MFA required.** Authentication is still incomplete; an unfinished
///     challenge outranks every authorization question below it.
///  7. **Account revoked**, (8) **suspended** — the account's own lifecycle,
///     revocation first because it is the terminal one.
///  9. **Tenant deleted**, (10) **tenant deletion pending**, then (11)
///     **tenant suspended** — the customer's
///     lifecycle. After the account's: a person whose own access was withdrawn
///     is told that, not that their organisation is unavailable.
/// 12. **First-time / unlinked.** The account is fine and the customer is
///     fine; the account simply is not finished. Below the blocking states so
///     a suspended half-finished account is not invited to finish setting up.
/// 13. **Demo expired**, (14) **demo active** — before any role branch,
///     because a demo session must never be classified by a real surface's
///     rules even if it somehow carried a role.
/// 15. **Role → surface.** `super_admin` to the platform; everyone else to
///     the tenant application.
/// 16. **Tenant no-access.** Last, and only for a tenant account that got
///     this far: it is the narrowest outcome and every state above it is a
///     better explanation of the same empty screen.
/// 17. **The requested route**, which the existing capability guards then
///     answer for themselves.
