/// The Sync Center (`/more/sync`) — one screen that answers "is my work
/// saved and sent?", and the single destination the dashboard's sync alerts
/// and the sync notifications lead to.
///
/// It hosts [SyncSettingsSection] inside its own scaffold and nothing else:
/// the status, the last successful sync, the counts, the one sync button and
/// the quiet Needs Review row all live in that one card, over the one outbox
/// and the one coordinator both sync paths use. Its loading and failure
/// states live there too, so this screen has no state of its own to get out
/// of step. Auto Sync still never navigates; Manual Sync still never
/// force-opens a conflict; the attention row still opens Needs Review only
/// on an explicit tap.
