/// On first read the notifier asks the repository for the stored value.
/// If none is stored, it seeds from the OS: `performance` when the platform
/// reports reduce-motion, otherwise `balanced`.
///
/// The seed is only a starting point. Whether an accessibility request is
/// *honoured* is decided at render time in `motionSpec`, which returns
/// `MotionSpec.none` whenever the platform asks for animations off — so a
/// user who later picks a richer level still gets the accessible
/// behaviour they asked the OS for.
